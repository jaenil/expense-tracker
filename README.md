Hi there ,this is a repository for a project that I started with recently.

React Hooks used in this project are :
    1)Context Api
    2)React State

Possible Contribution :
    1)Backend development


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
